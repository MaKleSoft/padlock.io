title: How to Import Your SecuStore Data Into Padlock
---

Here is how to easily migrate your data from SecuStore to Padlock. Only one Set
can be imported at a time, so you'll have to repeat the following steps for all
of your Sets.

1. Open the Set you want to import
2. Click on the gear icon in the bottom right corner and select **"Create backup"**

3. In the following screen, click the icon in the bottom right corner to copy
   the encrypted backup to the clipboard

4. [Download Padlock](/downloads/)
5. Open the Padlock app, then navigate to the Import screen (**Settings > Import Data**)
6. From the dropdown menu on the top, select **"SecuStore Backup"**

7. Click the icon in the top right corner to paste the data into the input
   field
   {{< figure src="/img/import-secustore-4.png" alt="Paste From Clipboard" >}}
8. Click the **"Import"** button
9. You'll be asked for the password for this Set. Enter the correct one.
10. Done! Repeat the above steps for any additional Sets you may have. Padlock
   does not have individual "Sets", or folders but instead allows you to
organize your records into categories. The name of your Set will automatically
be added as the category to each of its records.
