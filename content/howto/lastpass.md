 ## 5 Easy Steps to Move Your Data from LastPass to Padlock

Starting with version **0.10.1**, Padlock supports importing data directly from a
LastPass CSV file, which means it is now easier than ever to move your data from LastPass
over to Padlock. **Here is how to do it in 5 easy steps:**

- In LastPass, go to **Tools > Advanced Tools > Export To > LastPass CSV file** and store the
    resulting file somewhere on your computer.
- Download Padlock [here](http://padlock.io).
- Open the LastPass CSV file in a text editor and copy its contents to the clipboard.
- In Padlock, go to **Settings > Import Data** and paste the LastPass CSV data into the text field.
- Make sure that 'LastPass Data' is selected in the dropdown menu at the top, then hit **import**.

**That's it!** All of your LastPass data should now be imported into Padlock! If you
have problems following the above steps or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact
us via [**support@padlock.io**](mailto:support@padlock.io)!
