## Why use a password manager?

Passwords are everywhere. We need them to access our computers, our email accounts and a ton of other services that we rely on. Unfortunately, passwords are a poor way of authentication. Strong passwords are hard to remember and the sheer number of different services makes it practically impossible to keep track of all of your credentials. Most people try to mitigate this by composing their passwords out of familiar things like names or birthdays, but these can be guessed easily and do not provide sufficient protection. Password reuse, which is also wide-spread, is even more dangerous and makes a lot of people easy targets for hackers. Password managers help you keep track of your passwords by providing a secure storage that is protected by a single master password. Good password managers keep your data safe by encrypting it with a strong cipher like AES.

## What's so cool about Padlock?

We believe that software should not only be useful but also simple and fun to use. Padlock is all about simplicity and usability. We deliberately left out features that make other password managers unnecessarily complex and potentially confusing. Padlock focuses only on the most essential functionality. **No clutter, no distractions**. We also put a high value on transparency and actively encourage inspection and contributions by other developers.

## How can I use it?

Padlock is now available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/padlock/npkoefjfcjbknoeadfkbcdpbapaamcif" target="_blank) and on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id871710139" target="_blank) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maklesoft.padlock" target="_blank). If you want to run your own version or simply play around with the source code, the project is available on [Github](https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock" target="_blank" class="source-link).

## Why should I trust you?

**You don't have to!** Padlock is completely open source and we actively encourage developers to inspect the source code and offer contributions. This not only makes it impossible for us to build in back doors but also helps to identify and eliminate possible security flaws quickly and efficiently.

## What is Padlock Cloud?

Padlock Cloud is a service that allows you to synchronize your Padlock data between multiple devices quickly and easily. You can connect to Padlock Cloud through the Padlock app simply by providing your email address. This address will then be used for authentication by sending you a confirmation link every time you want to connect one of your devices to Padlock Cloud. Padlock Cloud keeps an encrypted version of your data on our servers which can then be accessed from any device that has the Padlock app installed. Your data is encrypted and decrypted offline and never leaves your device in plain text. The encryption key used is derived from your master password which is only known by you. This means that we do not have access to your plain text data at any time. Just like Padlock, Padlock Cloud is free and completely open source. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock-cloud).
