Here is how to migrate your data from previous versions of Padloc (v2.7 or older)
to Padloc 3:

## Step 1: Export Your Data

Let's start by exporting your existing data from your "old" version 2 account. There are two ways to do this:

### From the Padlock Cloud dashboard

The easiest way to export your data is to download an encrypted backup from the
[Padlock Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard). Simply log in
with your email address, click "Advanced Options..." and then click "Download Encrypted Backup".
Store the file somewhere on your hard drive where you'll find it later!

### From the Desktop App

To do this, start the old Padlock desktop app (Padlock v2.7). If you currently don't have it installed, you
can download it from our [downloads page](/downloads/#legacy). No go to the settings screen,
click **"Export..."** and select the option to export your data as an encrypted
file. Choose a password and save the file to your computer.

## Step 2: Create A Padloc 3 Account

If you don't have a Padloc 3 account yet, create one now. To do this, simply
go to [https://web.padloc.app/signup](https://web.padloc.app/signup) and follow
the instructions. If you have an existing [Padlock Cloud](https://cloud.padlock.io) account,
any active subscriptions and payment methods will be carried over.

## Step 3: Import Your Data

Now you're ready to import your data into your Padloc 3 account! If you haven't
yet, go to [https://web.padloc.app](https://web.padloc.app) and login. Now go
to settings and click **"Import..."**. Select the file you created in step 1 and follow
the instructions.

## Step 4: Delete Your Padlock Cloud Account (Optional)

If you have an existing [Padlock Cloud](https://cloud.padlock.io) account, we
recommend deleting it after you have migrated your data. To do this, log into
the [Padlock Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard) and select
**"Advanced Options > Delete Account"**.

## Step 5: Install Padloc 3 On All Your Devices

Now that you have successfully migrated to Padloc 3, you want to make sure that
you have the correct version installed on all your devices (the "legacy"
version of the app is still available in the app stores but can't be used to
log into your Padloc 3 account). You can find links for all platforms on our
[download page](/downloads/).

## Step 6. Enjoy Using Padloc 3

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ We hope you'll enjoy using Padloc 3. If you have any questions, please
