Here is how to migrate your data from previous versions of Padloc (v2.7 or older)
to Padloc 3:

## Step 1: Export Your Data

Let's start by exporting your existing data. To do this, start the old Padlock
app (Padlock v2.7) and go to the settings screen. Click **"Export..."** and select
the option to export your data as an encrypted file. Choose a password and save
the file to your computer.

## Step 2: Create A Padloc 3 Account

If you don't have a Padloc 3 account yet, create one now. To do this, simply
go to [https://web.padloc.app/signup](https://web.padloc.app/signup) and follow
the instructions. If you have an existing [Padlock Cloud](https://cloud.padlock.io) account,
any active subscriptions and payment methods will be carried over.

## Step 3: Import Your Data

Now you're ready to import your data into your Padloc 3 account! If you haven't
yet, go to [https://web.padloc.app](https://web.padloc.app) and login. Now go
to settings and click **"Import..."**. Select the file you created in step 1 and follow
the instructions.

## Step 4: Delete Your Padlock Cloud Account (Optional)

If you have an existing [Padlock Cloud](https://cloud.padlock.io) account, we
recommend deleting it after you have migrated your data. To do this, log into
the [Padlock Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard) and select
**"Advanced Options > Delete Account"**.
