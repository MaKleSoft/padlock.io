## 5 Easy Steps to Move Your Data from LastPass to Padlock

Padlock supports importing data directly from a LastPass CSV file, which means
it is incredibly easy to move your data from LastPass over to Padlock. **Here
is how to do it in 5 easy steps:**

1. Export your LastPass data as a CSV file. Details on how to do this can be
   found [here](https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=1206).
2. Download Padlock [here](https://padlock.io/downloads/).
3. Open the app and set up your account.
4. Click the little gear icon in the header on the top to get to the
   **Settings** page.
5. Under the **Import** section, click the icon next to **Select a File** and
   select the file you exported from LastPass.

On iOS and Android, the **Select a File** is not available.
Instead, you have to copy your data to the clipboard first and then click the
icon next to **Paste From Clipboard**.
