In August 2016, [Google
announced](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html) that
they would be **discontinuing support for Chrome Web Apps for all Platforms
except ChromeOS by early 2018**. [Padlock for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/padlock/npkoefjfcjbknoeadfkbcdpbapaamcif)
was the first version of Padlock available on the Desktop, but even before
Googles announcement it was getting clear that it was time to find a
better way to distribute Padlock for Desktop environments. Last year we
released the first beta versions of our native apps for [MacOS]({{< relref
"mac-beta.md" >}}) and [Windows]({{< relref "win-beta.md" >}}). With the
[release of Padlock 2.0]({{< relref "v2.0-released.md" >}}), these are now
officially out of beta! Our native apps feature the same user experience,
higher security and a better performance than Padlock for Chrome so there is no
reason not to switch right now!

**Note:** This announcement is only for Padlock for Chrome on Windows, MacOS
and Linux. Padlock will continue to be available for ChromeOS via the Chrome
Web Store for the foreseeable future.

## How To Switch

Switching from Padlock for Chrome to the native desktop app is easy! First,
head over to the [downloads page](/downloads/) and download the native app for
your platform. Second, migrate your data over. There are two ways to migrate your
data from Padlock for Chrome to the native app.

### Via Padlock Cloud

The easiest way to migrate your data is to synchronize it via [Padlock
Cloud](https://cloud.padlock.io). If you haven't used Padlock Cloud before,
check out [this article]({{< relref "guides/sync.md" >}}) on how to
synchronize your data with Padlock Cloud!

### Via Export / Import

A slighly more pedestrian way to move your data is to export it from
Padlock for Chrome first, and then import the same file to the native app.
The following articles explain how to use Padlocks import and export features:
