This privacy policy documents how and when Padlock stores, handles and
processes user data, specifically your sensitive, private and 'personal
identifiable' information as well as your rights regarding this data. Since
this document is meant to inform you, the user, it is written in plain, easily
understandable language. We will try to communicate to you all the most
important facts without going into too much technical detail or overwhelming
you with too much information. Please read this document carefully. If you have
any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at
[support@padlock.io](support@padlock.io)!

As a user of Padlock, you entrust us with some of your most sensitive and
private data and we recognise the immense responsibility that comes with this.
Padlock is built from the ground up with a focus on security, privacy
and transparency and we employ these principles every step along the way
when handling your data. As a security-sensitive service, cryptography and
information security is at the very heart of our product and while these
topics can be very hard to grasp for non-technical users, we do our best
to describe the most important principles in simple words.

## Who We Are

Padlock is maintained and run by **MaKleSoft**, a German company located at
Meisenstr. 5, 91522 Ansbach, Bavaria. MaKleSoft and all of it's employees are
bound by EU privacy laws and regulations like the **General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

## Information We Collect And How We Use It

While we treat all your data with the same high standard of security,
there are different types of data and it is important to understand
the distinction between them.

### Secure Data

Your secure data is all the information you store within the Padlock app, like
passwords, credit card details, secure notes and other sensitive (or
non-sensitive) information. By design this data is readable by you and only
you. Your secure data is encrypted locally on your devices using encryption
keys that are derived from your master password that only you know and your
data is never stored or transmitted in plain text. While you may choose to
store your encrypted data on our servers for synchronization or backup purposes
we are never in the position to decrypt this data.

We never store your master password in any way and will never ask you to reveal
it to us. Please note that this also means that we won't be able to help you
recover you plain text data in case you loose your password.

Your secure data is your property and you have full control over it. You
may read, edit or delete your local data at any point without our permission.
Accessing your secure data stored on our servers requires authentication via
your email address. Note that synchronization and online storage is a paid
service and updating your online data requires an active subscription. Should
you decide to cancel your subscription or not purchase one at the end of your
trial period, your online data will remain accessible in a "read-only" state,
which means you will be able to download or delete it, but you won't be able
to upload any changes.

### Account Meta Data

In order to provide advanced services like synchronization and online backups,
we require some additional information from you. The first and most important
piece of information is your email address. Your email address is used to
uniquely identify your account and serves as a means of authentication. In
order to "log in" to your Padlock online account, you provide your email
address which is sent to our servers and a "login request" request is created.
An email is then sent to your address containing either a "login code" or an
"login link", depending on what version of the app you're using. Both
serve the same purpose - to verify that you are in fact the owner of the
email account in question. Once you've successfully completed this verification
step, your device will be paired with your Padlock online account, allowing
you to upload your secure data into the cloud and share it with your other devices.
The first time this happens, an account object is created and stored on our
servers, containing your email address along with other information, like
the creation date and information related to the device in question. For details
on what device-specific information is gathered, consult the section
[Device-specific Information](#device-specific-information).

#### Device-specific Information

Device-specific information includes:

- Device UUID<sup>1</sup>
- Operating System and OS Version
- Device Manufacturer (if available)
- Device Model (if available)
- Device Name (if available)
- App Version
- Pairing Date
- Last Access

This information is essential for preventing fraud and to provide you
fine-grained control of which devices you want to allow (and continue to allow)
access to your account. Information about your device model, operating
system and OS version also helps us notifying you in case we are made aware
of security vulnerabilities specific to your device or operating system.

<sup>1</sup> Your devices "Universal Unique Identifier" is a unique, random
string of characters used to uniquely identify a given device in our systems.
This string is generated automatically and is _not_ directly tied to your devices
serial number, mac address or other immutable identifiers unique to your device.
In other words, this is only useful for our internal use and is not considered
personal identifiable information.

### Usage Data

For our internal use, we track basic usage data like app installs, updates
and device activity. Since Padlock is a security-sensitive application that
requires constant maintenance and security updates to patch vulnerabilities and
maintain it's high standard in security, it is essential for us to know which
app versions are in circulation and on which kind of devices. For instance,
knowing which operating systems make up the majority of our user base, we are
able to prioritize OS-specific vulnerabilities should they arise. This usage
data is completely anonymised and does not contain any personal identifiable
information.

### Server Logs

Like most internet services, we keep internal logs of all requests sent to our
servers. These logs are an essential tool for identifying and blocking
malicious traffic and help us detect and prevent break-in attempts. These logs
may contain some personal identifiable information like IP addresses.
As with all the data that we collect, we treat these log files with utmost care
and restrict access to them to key personnel. Log files are only kept as long
as absolutely necessary after which they are deleted from our servers.

### Billing Information

If you choose to purchase a paid subscription, your payment data is processed
and stored securely by our payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com). In
addition to your credit card data, you may choose to provide us with additional
billing information like your full name, address and, in case of business
customers, your business name and VAT number.

### Cookies and Tracking

We set and use cookies (small text files placed on your device) on our own
domains and subdomains to store settings that assist with identifying your
account for sign-in. We also use third party analytics packages for our public
pages that may set cookies on your computer. These are limited to our domains,
and do not involve cross-service tracking. You may disable cookies in your
browser and continue to use our services without impact.

## Where Your Data Is Kept

Your data is held by third party data processors, who provide us with hosting
and other infrastructure services. All of these providers are GDPR-compliant
and conform to the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield Framework.

## Who Has Access To Your Data

Your personal information is stored behind secured networks and is only
accessible by a very limited number of persons who have special access rights
to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.

## Third Party Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does
not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in
operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as
those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

## Deleting Your Data

We are merely custodians of your data and we have no interested in keeping your
personal information any longer than you want us to or is required by law. You
can delete your Padlock online account at any time through the [Padlock Online
Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/). Data stored locally within
the Padlock app can be deleted directly through the app itself.

German tax law requires us to keep payment transaction records and, in case of
business customers, company and VAT information for up to 10 years. This data
does not include your credit or debit card information which is deleted
instantly after deleting your Padlock online account.

Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that we have a
legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups. Erasure
requests will leave those backups untouched, and we will only remove data from
backups if legally compelled to. Backups are permanently deleted after 3
months.

## Contacting You

We may use your contact information to communicate with you about service
activity, provide support, and send you other information such as product
updates and announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications from
us, except certain important notifications such as billing and account security
alerts.
